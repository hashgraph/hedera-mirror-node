# Smart Contracts

## Purpose

Smart contracts have existed on Hedera since Open Access, but the mirror node has never stored all the data associated
with smart contract transactions in its database. With the
[announcement](https://hedera.com/blog/hedera-evm-smart-contracts-now-bring-highest-speed-programmability-to-tokenization)
to bring high speed smart contract execution to the Hedera network, it has become more important to ensure the mirror
node is storing the appropriate smart contract information and making it retrievable via its APIs.

## Goals

- Enhance the database schema to store all contract-related information from transactions and transaction records
- Enhance the REST API to retrieve smart contracts and their execution results
- Enhance the REST API to search by smart contract log topics
- Explore alternative smart contract APIs including compatibility
  with [Ethereum JSON-RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) APIs

## Non-Goals

- Ensure 100% compatibility with all Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs
- Execute smart contracts on the mirror node

## Architecture

### Database

#### Contract

Create a contract table that has most of the same fields as the entity table. A database migration should move entries
in `entity` into `contract` if they are of type contract or have contract create or update transactions. The
contract-specific fields will need to be marked as nullable since we didn't store them on any existing tables.

```sql
create table if not exists contract
(
  auto_renew_period    bigint                         null,
  created_timestamp    bigint                         null,
  deleted              boolean                        null,
  evm_address          bytea                          null,
  expiration_timestamp bigint                         null,
  file_id              bigint                         null,
  id                   bigint                         not null,
  key                  bytea                          null,
  memo                 text        default ''         not null,
  num                  bigint                         not null,
  obtainer_id          bigint                         null,
  proxy_account_id     bigint                         null,
  public_key           character varying              null,
  realm                bigint                         not null,
  shard                bigint                         not null,
  timestamp_range      int8range                      not null,
  type                 entity_type default 'CONTRACT' not null,
  primary key (id)
);
```

#### Contract History

Create a contract history table that is populated by application upsert logic. It should insert the old row to the
history table after setting its timestamp range to end (exclusively) at the new row's start consensus timestamp.

```sql
create table if not exists contract_history
(
  like contract including defaults,
  primary key (id, timestamp_range)
);

create index if not exists contract_history__timestamp_range on contract_history using gist (timestamp_range);
```

#### Contract Result

Update the existing `contract_result` to capture all fields present in the protobuf (see below).
Replace `consensus_timestamp` index with `consensus_timestamp` primary key. Migrate data in `call_result` to parse it
using the protobuf and normalize it into the other fields.

```sql
create table if not exists contract_result
(
  account_access       bigint array       null,
  amount               bigint             null,
  bloom                bytea              null,
  call_result          bytea              null,
  consensus_timestamp  bigint primary key not null,
  contract_id          bigint             null,
  created_contract_ids bigint array       null,
  error_message        text               null,
  function_parameters  bytea              not null,
  function_result      bytea              null,
  gas_limit            bigint             not null,
  gas_used             bigint             not null,
  payer_account_id     bigint             not null,
  primary key (consensus_timestamp)
);

create index if not exists contract_result__id_payer_timestamp
  on contract_result (contract_id, payer_account_id, consensus_timestamp);
```

#### Contract Log

Create a new table to store the results of the contract's log output.

```sql
create table if not exists contract_log
(
  bloom               bytea  not null,
  consensus_timestamp bigint not null,
  contract_id         bigint not null,
  data                bytea  not null,
  index               int    not null,
  payer_account_id    bigint not null,
  root_contract_id    bigint null,
  topic0              bytea  null,
  topic1              bytea  null,
  topic2              bytea  null,
  topic3              bytea  null,
  primary key (consensus_timestamp, index)
);

create index if not exists contract_log__id_timestamp
  on contract_log (contract_id, consensus_timestamp);
```

#### Contract Access List

Create a new table to store the access list of a contract execution

```sql
create table if not exists contract_access
(
  consensus_timestamp bigint      not null,
  contract_id         bigint      not null,
  initial_contract_id bigint      not null,
  payer_account_id    bigint      not null,
  storage_keys        bytea array not null,
  primary key (consensus_timestamp, initial_contract_id, contract_id)
);
```

#### Contract State Change

Create a new table to store the state changes of a contract execution

```sql
create table if not exists contract_state_change
(
  consensus_timestamp bigint not null,
  contract_id         bigint not null,
  payer_account_id    bigint not null,
  slot                bytea  not null,
  value_read          bytea  not null,
  value_written       bytea  null,
  primary key (consensus_timestamp, contract_id, slot)
);
```

- `block_hash` should be retrieved by a join with the `record_file` table to find the `hash` of the file containing the
  transaction.
- `hash` should be retrieved by a join with the `transaction` table
- `logs` should be retrieved by a join between the `contract_result` and `contract_log` tables.
- `state_changes` should be retrieved by a join between the `contract_result` and `contract_state_change` tables.

### JSON-RPC

On the Ethereum network, all client nodes implement
the [Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification](https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/eth1.0-apis/assembled-spec/openrpc.json)
methods for ease of interaction by DApps.

The HyperLedger Besu EVM supports the methods captured
at [ETH methods](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#eth-methods)

The Mirror Node should implement a subset of the standard calls used to:

- Support existing Ethereum developers who may call the JSON-RPC endpoints directly.
- Encompass Hedera EVM translation logic that can be wrapped by potential Web3 modules.

#### Setup

- Create a new Maven module `hedera-mirror-web3`
- Create a new Maven module `hedera-mirror-common` that encompasses all domain POJOs and repositories
- Use Spring WebFlux to establish a JSON-RPC server
  with [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) support to service rpc calls
- Use `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` for database access
- Create a Helm child chart `hedera-mirror-web3` and add to Kubernetes deployment flow
- Add to CI and utilize a Postman collection for endpoint verification

#### Domain/Repository

Existing domain classes can be utilized from the `hedera-mirror-common` dependencies. Applicable CRUD repositories can
be created using Spring based on `hedera-mirror-common` domains to extract information from the database.

#### Service

- `Web3Service` interface that describes the supported rpc methods
- Implement `Web3Service` for each of the supported RPC methods. Methods query the appropriate tables and return data in
  the expected format.

#### Request

Requests are typically of the below JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "",
  "params": []
}
```

Its corresponding model:

```java
class JsonRpcRequest<T> {
  private Long id;
  private String jsonrpc;
  private String method;
  private T params;
}
  ```

#### Response

Responses are typically of the standard [JSON-RPC format](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object).

- Successful response
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "0x1"
  }
  ```

- Failed response
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": -32600,
      "data": "id field must not be null",
      "message": "Invalid Request"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
  }
  ```

> _Note:_ `result` data type is dynamic. Either `result` or `error` must be present in a response, not both.

An appropriate set of models would be:

- `JsonRpcResponse`
  ```java
  @Data
  class JsonRpcSuccessResponse<T> {
    private Long id;
    private final String jsonrpc = "2.0";
    private T result;
  }
  ```

- `JsonRpcErrorResponse`
  ```java
  class JsonRpcErrorResponse {
    private Long id;
    private final String jsonrpc = "2.0";
    private JsonRpcError error;

    private class JsonRpcError {
      private int code;
      private String data;
      private String message;
    }
  }
  ```

The result field will be populated with the value to be returned. Additional classes per complex response value should
be added. The value can range from regular data types (String, int, array) to defined Ethereum objects such as:

- [Block](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Objects/#block-object)
- [Log](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Objects/#log-object)
- [Transaction](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Objects/#transaction-object)

#### ETH Method Analysis

The Mirror Node is essentially a full archive node (i.e. it can provide the state of the ledger at present but also at
multiple snapshots of time). However, its current implementation is limited by the lack of connectivity to the actual
Gossip based network of consensus nodes. As a result some network specific details are not available to it unless
provided through the record stream and therefore some `eth_` related methods may not be applicable to its current
iteration. Below is a table of compatibility. All methods are referenced from the Ethereum
Wikis [JSON-RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)

#### Custom RPC Methods

In addition to the official Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification, some node clients provide additional methods that provide
additional value to many developers
e.g. [Besu RPC Pubc/Sub](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub/#rpc-pubsub-over-websockets)
The Mirror Node should additional provide support for this.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Support peak smart contract call TPS (400+)
- Support peak smart contract call gas per second (15 million)
- Support max smart contract call size (6K)
- Support max smart contract call state and output size (~4M gas or 900 KiB)
- Latency remains under 10s end to end at peak contract TPS

## Open Questions

1. What will the externalization of the contract call type in the transaction record look like? Still being designed.
2. How will EVM internal transactions (i.e. non HTS precompiled child transactions) show up in record stream and will
   they follow a hierarchy that highlights transfer succession or will it be flattened? Still being designed.
3. How should we expose EVM internal transactions under `/api/v1/contracts/{id}/results/{timestamp}`
   & `/api/v1/contracts/results/{transactionId}`? Still being designed. One suggestion under is
    ```json
      "evm_internal_transactions": [
        {
          "from": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001002",
          "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001003",
          "type": "call_0",
          "value": "20"
        }
      ]
    ```

## Answered Questions

1. How should we allow searching by topics or logs? Ans: By topics, with timestamp filter on logs.
2. How will Hedera transactions triggered from a smart contract be externalized in the record stream? Ans: Each contract
   triggered transaction will show up as a separate transaction and record with an incremented consensus timestamp and a
   parent timestamp populated.
3. Should we show individual function parameters in a normalized form? Ans: We decided against it at this time as it
   might be a performance concern or require parsing the solidity contract. Can revisit in the future by adding a new
   field with the normalized structure.
4. Should `from`, `to`, `transactionHash` and `blockNumber` be included in `api/v1/contract/{id}/result/{timestamp}`
   as it maps closely to
   Ethereum's [transactionReceipt](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth.html#gettransaction)
   Ans: Yes, as we can easily extract from transaction and record tables.
5. Would a custom `api/v1/evm` or `api/v1/eth` endpoint be valuable and needed to provide a separation of concern
   between Hedera and Ethereum logic. Ans: Though valuable to the separation of concern it brings too much overhead, and
   the endpoint themselves aren't known to existing developers. Better to put effort on existing endpoints and JSON-RPC
6. With the use of `transaction_id` to retrieve entity metadata rows should we consider a caching and or db mapping to
   extract the entityId and timestamp? Ans: For now caching and internal db mapping not needed. We'll simply do 2 calls
   to get transaction info and then contract details.
7. How should we expose Hedera child transactions under `/api/v1/contracts/{id}/results/{timestamp}`
   and `/api/v1/contracts/results/{transactionId}`? Users can get a flattened list of parent and child transactions
   via `/api/v1/transaction/{transactionId}` and use that to query the contract results.

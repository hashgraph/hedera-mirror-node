# GraphQL Contract Log Subscription

## Purpose

Provide a GraphQL equivalent of the Ethereum
JSON-RPC [eth_subscribe](https://docs.infura.io/infura/networks/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/subscription-methods/eth_subscribe)
in order to provide contract log notifications in almost real time.

## Goals

- Stream contract log notifications via a GraphQL subscription
- Ensure at most once delivery. Will drop messages on backpressure overflow

## Non-Goals

- Will not query historical logs

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Need to ensure resource consumption is within reasonable bounds (reasonable bounds TBD via experimentation)
- Ensure performance is within reasonable bounds (reasonable bounds TBD via experimentation)

## Architecture

![Architecture](images/contract-log-subscription-architecture.png)

### Importer

1. Update RedisEntityListener (or create new listener) to send contract logs to contract_logs topic

- Populate the ContractLogEvent for topic message submission
- Messages will be serialized via RedisSerializer using msgpack

### GraphQL

- Use reactive websockets
- We should implement rate limiting in the load balancer
- Use AtomicLong to track active subscriptions
- Uses msgpack for topic message serialization

1. Create GraphQL schema for Input / Output
2. Create ContractLogEvent Mapper
3. Create Controller with @SubscriptionMapping
4. Create RedisConfiguration to configure msgpack serializer
5. Create a Redis Subscriber to listen for messages on contract_logs topic
6. Capture metrics (Some of these may already be provided by Redis or GraphQL)

- subscriber consumption rate
- Active subscriptions counter
- Messages received (From redis topic) rate

#### GraphQL Schema

```graphql
"Represents a Hedera Contract Log event"
type ContractLogEvent {
  "The evm address (if available, otherwise the account-num alias) from which this log originated"
  address: String!

  "The hash of the block in which the transaction was included"
  blockHash: String!

  "The number of the block in which the transaction was included"
  blockNumber: Int64!

  "The contract entity id"
  contractId: EntityId!

  "Contains one or more 32 Bytes non-indexed arguments of the log"
  data: String!

  "The index or position of the log entry within the block"
  logIndex: Int64!

  """
  An array of 0 to 4 32 bytes topic hashes of indexed log arguments.
  """
  topics: [String!]!

  "The hash of the transaction (first 32-byte of the 48-byte HAPI transaction hash)"
  transactionHash: String!

  "The index or position of the transaction within the block"
  transactionIndex: Int64!
}

"Represents addresses and topics a subscriber wishes to subscribe to"
input ContractLogSubscription {
  "Only logs created from one of these EVM addresses will be emitted."
  addresses: [String!] @Pattern(regexp: "^(0x)?[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$")

  """
  Topic specifier for position 0. An empty array indicates any value is allowed for this position.
  [A,B] indicates a log will be emitted when either A or B is in that position

#### application.yml

```yaml
hedera:
  mirror:
    graphql:
      listener:
        contractLog:
          maxActiveSubscriptions: 10
          maxBufferSize: 16384
          keepAlive: 1m
```

#### Example Request Body

Addresses and topics are both optional filters

```graphql
{
  contractLogs(
    subscription: {
      addresses: ["EVM_ADDRESS_ALIAS OR ACCOUNT_NUM_ALIAS"]
      topic0: ["ARRAY_OF_CONTRACT_TOPICS"]
      topic1: ["ARRAY_OF_CONTRACT_TOPICS"]
      topic2: ["ARRAY_OF_CONTRACT_TOPICS"]
      topic3: ["ARRAY_OF_CONTRACT_TOPICS"]
    }
  ) {
    address
    blockHash
    blockNumber
    data
    logIndex
    topics
    transactionHash
    transactionIndex
  }
}
```

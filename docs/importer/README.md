## Reconciliation Job

The reconciliation job verifies that the data within the stream files are in sync with each other and with the mirror
node database. This process runs once a day at midnight and produces logs, metrics, and alerts if reconciliation fails.

For each balance file, the job verifies it sums to 50 billion hbars. For every pair of balance files, it verifies the
aggregated hbar transfers in that period match what's expected in the next balance file. It also verifies the aggregated
token transfers match the token balance and that the NFT transfers match the expected NFT count in the balance file.

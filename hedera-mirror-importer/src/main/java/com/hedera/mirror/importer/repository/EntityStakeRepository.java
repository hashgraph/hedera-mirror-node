     * <p>
     * 3. IF the current stake_period_start > the day before last epochDay, no reward's should be earned, set pending
     * reward to 0
     * <p>
     * 4. IF the current stake_period_start equals to the day before last epochDay (either its staking metadata or
     * balance changed in the previous staking period), calculate the reward it has earned in the ending staking period
     * as its pending reward
     * <p>
     * 5. IF the current stake_period_start is more than 365 days before the last epochDay, deduct the reward earned
     * in staking period last epochDay - 365, and add the reward earned in last epochDay since staking reward is kept
     * for up to 365 days counting back from the last staking period.
     * <p>
     * 6. Otherwise, there's no staking metadata or balance change for the entity since the start of the ending staking
     * period, add the reward earned in the ending period to the current as the new pending reward

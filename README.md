# Hedera Mirror Node

Hedera Mirror Node exposes Hedera Hashgraph transactions, transaction records, account balances,
and events generated by the Hedera mainnet (or testnet, if so configured) via a REST & gRPC API.

## Overview

Hedera mirror nodes receive the information from the mainnet nodes and they provide value-added services such as providing audit support, access to historical data, transaction analytics, visibility services, security threat modeling, data monetization services, etc. Mirror nodes can also run additional business logic to support applications built using Hedera mainnet.

While mirror nodes receive information from the mainnet nodes, they do not contribute to consensus on the mainnet, and their votes are not counted. Only the votes from the mainnet nodes are counted for determining consensus. The trust of Hedera mainnet is derived based on the the consensus reached by the mainnet nodes. That trust is transferred to the mirror nodes using cryptographic signatures on a chain of records (account balances, events, transactions, etc).

## Beta Mirror Node

Eventually, the mirror nodes can run the same code as the Hedera mainnet nodes so that they can see the transactions in real time. To make the initial deployments easier, the beta mirror node strives to take away the burden of running a full Hedera node through creation of periodic files that contain processed information (such as account balances or transaction records), and have the full trust of the Hedera mainnet nodes. The beta mirror node software reduces the processing burden by receiving pre-constructed files from the mainnet, validating those, populating a database and providing REST APIs.

### Advantages

-   Lower compute, bandwidth requirement
-   It allows users to only save what they care about, and discard what they don’t (lower storage requirement)
-   Easy searchable database so the users can add value quickly
-   Easy to consume REST APIs to make integrations faster

### Description

The beta mirror node works as follows:

-   When a transaction reaches consensus, Hedera nodes add the transaction and its associated record to a record file.
-   The file is closed on a regular cadence and a new file is created for the next batch of transactions and records. The interval is currently set to 5 seconds but may vary between networks.
-   Once the file is closed, nodes generate a signature file which contains the signature generated by the node for the record file.
-   Record files also contain the hash of the previous record file, thus creating an unbreakable validation chain.

-   The signature and record files are then uploaded from the nodes to Amazon S3 and Google File Storage.

-   This mirror node software downloads signature files from either S3 or Google File Storage.
-   The signature files are validated to ensure at least 1/3 of the nodes in the address book (stored in a `0.0.102` file) have the same signature.
-   For each valid signature file, the corresponding record file is then downloaded from the cloud.
-   Record files can then be processed and transactions and records processed for long term storage.

-   Event files are handled in same manner as record files.

-   In addition, nodes regularly generate a balance file which contains the list of Hedera accounts and their corresponding balance which is also uploaded to S3 and Google File Storage.
-   The files are also signed by the nodes.
-   This mirror node software can download the balance files, validate at least 1/3 of nodes have signed and then process the balance files for long term storage.

### Prerequisite Tools
Ensure these tools are installed prior to running the mirror node

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Running Mirror Node (Importer, gRPC API and REST API)

To run the mirror node, execute these 3 commands in your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node.git
cd hedera-mirror-node
docker-compose up
```
> **_NOTE:_** This defaults to a bucket setup for demonstration purposes. The real bucket name is not currently publicly available.
> See [Testnet / Mainnet](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node#Testnet/Mainnet) section for how to configure for real data
## Data Access
### Demo
The free option utilizes a bucket setup for demonstration purposes. The real bucket name is not currently publicly available.
This is the default option and requires no additional steps.

### Testnet / Mainnet
To access real data from the testnet or mainnet buckets the requester pays flow for [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays) or [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) must be utilized.
Here the charges associated with request and download of transaction data are paid for by the requester and not the bucket owner.

To achieve this, 2 simple steps must be taken to configure the mirror node
- Uncomment the contents of [application.yml](./application.yml) file under the root folder
- Customize the contents according to your setup. See [configurations](docs/configuration.md) for detailed descriptions of config options.

> **_Note_** The [application.yml](./application.yml) file contents represent the minimal set of fields required to configure requester pays and must all be uncommented and filled in. The file is referenced in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and allows customized configuration for each of the sub modules.


See the [Docker compose Startup section](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/blob/master/docs/installation.md#running-via-docker-compose) for further details


### Verify Operational Mirror Node
When running the Mirror Node using docker, activity logs and container status for each module container can be viewed in [docker desktop Dashboard](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dashboard/) to verify expected operation.

You can also interact with some module containers (gRPC and REST API's) to verify their operation.

First list running docker container information using

     docker ps
Useful information for all the running containers such as CONTAINER ID, STATUS, IP's and ports will be displayed as below

    CONTAINER ID    IMAGE                                           COMMAND                 CREATED         STATUS          PORTS                   NAMES
    21fa2a986d99    gcr.io/mirrornode/hedera-mirror-rest:0.12.0     "docker-entrypoint.s…"  7 minutes ago   Up 12 seconds   0.0.0.0:5551->5551/tcp  hedera-mirror-node_rest_1
    56647c384d49    gcr.io/mirrornode/hedera-mirror-grpc:0.12.0     "java -cp /app/resou…"  8 minutes ago   Up 16 seconds   0.0.0.0:5600->5600/tcp  edera-mirror-node_grpc_1

An 'Up' STATUS confirms the mirror node sub modules are running.

Using the IP and port, the gRPC and REST API's endpoints can be called to confirm data is processed and available.

Using the CONTAINER ID docker containers can be accessed for in depth troubleshooting.

#### Importer
Logs similar to the following snippets can be used to confirm the Importer is downloading and parsing transactions to the database

    Current version of schema "public": << Empty Schema >>
    ...
    Migrating schema "public" to version 1.0 - Init
    ...
    Successfully applied 41 migrations to schema "public" (execution time 00:01.656s)
    ...
    Loading record format version 2 from record file: ...
    Inserted 2 transactions, 6 transfer lists, 0 files, 0 contracts, 0 claims, 0 topic messages, 0 non-fee transfers
    Finished parsing 2 transactions from record file ....

#### Database
The following log can be used to confirm the database is up and running

    LOG: database system is ready to accept connections

If you have postgresql installed you can connect directly to your database using the following psql command and default [configurations](docs/configuration.md)

    psql "dbname=mirror_node host=localhost user=mirror_node password=mirror_node_pass port=5432"

If psql is not available you can `docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash` into the db container and run the same command above

Some useful basic queries to help view database contents and data include

    \du
    select * from account_balances limit 5;
    select * from transactions limit 5;
    select * from topic_message limit 5;

#### REST API
The REST API container will display logs similar to the below at start

    Server running on port: 5551

The REST API endpoints can be verified either through the browser or the terminal.
The following endpoints are suggestions that can be accessed from your browser. Modify the below IP's and ports if they differ from your running containers.

    http://127.0.0.1:5551/api/v1/accounts
    http://127.0.0.1:5551/api/v1/balances
    http://127.0.0.1:5551/api/v1/transactions

When using the terminal simply use the `curl` command on the above endpoints. e.g.

    curl http://127.0.0.1:5551/api/v1/transactions

#### gRPC API
The gRPC container will display logs similar to the below at start

    MirrorGrpcApplication Started MirrorGrpcApplication ....
    Listener Starting to poll every 1000ms

The gRPC streaming endpoint can be verified using clients that support [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/)
Some useful clients we're encountered include
- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)
    - run the following command making substitutions for {topicNum}, {grpcContainerIP} and {grpcContainerPort} appropriately

            grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"topicID":{"shardNum":0,"realmNum":0,"topicNum":{topicNum}},"consensusStartTime":{"seconds":0,"nanos":0},"limit":10}' {grpcContainerIP}:{grpcContainerPort} com.hedera.mirror.api.proto.ConsensusService/subscribeTopic

- [Bloom](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc)



Additionally logs on each module container can be viewed to verify expected operation or decipher issues - See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

Simply access the terminal on each container with the following command and refer to [Operations](docs/operations.md) document for directions on where and how to view logs

     docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash
> **_Note_** You cannot exec into the gRPC and Importer containers as they are [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) java images.

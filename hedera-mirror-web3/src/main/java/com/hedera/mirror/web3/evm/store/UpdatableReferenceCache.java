 *
 * Keeps track of current value of k/v pair, including if the key has been
 * deleted.  **Does not permit** a value to be "updated" because if you
 * actually _updated_ a reference associated with a key you'd _also_ be
 * changing that same reference in a lower-level cache, which would break
 * the intent of being able to commit/rollback.  Checked at runtime.  (But
 * prefer using an immutable type for the value so this problem simply
 * can't happen.)
 *
 * Type checking that the value type is consistent is the responsibility of
 * the caller.

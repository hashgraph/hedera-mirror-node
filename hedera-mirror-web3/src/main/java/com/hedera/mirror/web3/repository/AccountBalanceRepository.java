     * Finds the historical account balance for a given account ID based on a specific block timestamp.
     * This method calculates the historical balance by summing the crypto transfers and adding the sum to the initial balance
     * found at a timestamp less than the given block timestamp. If no account_balance is found for the given account_id
     * and consensus timestamp, a balance of 0 will be returned.
     *
     * FYI:
     * The database insertion operates on a periodic cycle where, every X minutes, Y number of account_balance entries are dumped for
     * accounts involved in crypto_transfers. This cycle includes entries for those accounts, and it always includes an
     * entry for treasury account 0.0.2. The timestamp of 0.0.2 marks the beginning of a new cycle and the end of the
     * previous one.
     *
     * The algorithm used in this method involves the following steps:
     * 1. Find the latest balance snapshot timestamp of treasury account 0.0.2 at or before blockTimestamp. This works because
     *    the design ensures that treasury account's balance info is never deduplicated, and there will be a row for the
     *    account in every snapshot. Let's call this timestamp balanceSnapshotTimestamp.
     * 2. Find the latest balance of the specified accountId in the range (balanceSnapshotTimestamp - 31 days, balanceSnapshotTimestamp].
     * 3. Sum the crypto transfers that occurred between the balance snapshot timestamp and the given block timestamp for the
     *    specified accountId. Exclude transfers with errata 'DELETE'.
     * 4. Calculate the historical balance by adding the balance found at step 2 to the sum calculated at step 3.
     *
     * @param accountId       the ID of the account.
     * @param blockTimestamp  the block timestamp used to filter the results.
     * @return an Optional containing the historical balance at the specified timestamp.
     *         If there are no crypto transfers between the consensus_timestamp of account_balance and the block timestamp,
     *         the method will return the balance present at consensus_timestamp.

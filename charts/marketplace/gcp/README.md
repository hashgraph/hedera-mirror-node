# Overview

# Building the deployment container

Apps are required to supply a 'deployer' deployment container image which is used in UI-based deployment.
The image should extend from one of the base images provided in the marketplace-k8s-app-tools repository.
This solution currently extends gcr.io/cloud-marketplace-tools/k8s/deployer_helm

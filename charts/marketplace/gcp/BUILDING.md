# Overview

This folder contains logic to support the development and deployment of the Hedera Mirror Node in a Kubernetes cluster
in [Google Cloud Platform Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace). It takes in the wrapper
`hedera-mirror` Helm chart and bundles it into the required deployer image which is built and pushed to Google Container
Registry on deploy.

# Setup

A Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster is required to verify and test the deployment of the Marketplace application.
Other clusters like minikube will not work. Follow the
GKE [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart) to create a test cluster. Once created,
manually install the `Application` custom resource definition (CRD) into the cluster.

```shell
kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools/master/crd/app-crd.yaml"
```

## Prerequisites

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [mpdev](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools/blob/master/docs/mpdev-references.md)

## Set environment variables

First ensure the following environment variables are populated with the appropriate version and names. These variables
will be used for the remainder of the document.

```shell
export NAME="marketplace"
export NAMESPACE="marketplace"
export TAG="x.y.z"
```

# Building

Apps are required to supply a `deployer` container image which is used in UI-based deployment. The image should extend
from one of the base images provided in the marketplace-k8s-app-tools registry. This solution currently
extends `gcr.io/cloud-marketplace-tools/k8s/deployer_helm`. Our deployer image build logic is specified in
the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

Additionally, GCP Marketplace restricts applications to images pulled from the Marketplace registry. Since the Mirror
Node uses some third party images like PostgreSQL, we need to re-publish these images to our staging registry and keep
them up to date. To republish postgresql-repmgr, run the following steps manually whenever it needs to change:

```shell
export PG_VERSION=16.6.0-debian-12-r3
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd containers/postgresql-repmgr/16/debian-12
docker buildx build . -t gcr.io/mirror-node-public/hedera-mirror-node/postgresql-repmgr:${PG_VERSION} --push --provenance false --platform linux/amd64 --annotation "manifest,manifest-descriptor:com.googleapis.cloudmarketplace.product.service.name=services/hedera-mirror-node-mirror-node-public.cloudpartnerservices.goog"
sed "s/postgresql_tag=.*/postgresql_tag=\"${PG_VERSION}\"/" release.sh
```

Run the below commands to re-tag existing images and build the deployer image for testing with Marketplace:

```shell
cd charts/marketplace/gcp
./release.sh "${TAG}"
```

# Testing

The mpdev tool is provided by Google Cloud Platform Marketplace to help verify the marketplace solution and install it.
If you are trying to run mpdev on a mac M1 arm64 machine, it will not work. Google has not provided an arm64 image.
You will need to create a non-arm64 VM to install mpdev and then run verify.

## Verify

Run `mpdev verify` to automatically install the application in a new namespace, execute acceptance tests against it and
uninstall it. Ensure [schema-test.yaml](schema-test.yaml) contains defaults for any required fields
in [schema.yaml](schema.yaml).

```shell
mpdev verify --deployer=gcr.io/mirror-node-public/hedera-mirror-node/deployer:${TAG}
```

## Install

To install run `mpdev install`. Note the properties in the `required` section of the [schema.yaml](schema.yaml)
file must be specified via the parameters flag.

```shell
kubectl create namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
mpdev install --deployer=gcr.io/mirror-node-public/hedera-mirror-node/deployer:${TAG} --parameters='{"name": "'${NAME}'",
    "namespace": "'${NAMESPACE}'",
    "importer.config.hedera.mirror.importer.downloader.accessKey": "GOOG1...",
    "importer.config.hedera.mirror.importer.downloader.secretKey": "...",
    "importer.config.hedera.mirror.importer.network": "MAINNET"}'
```

## Uninstall

Once installed in a Kubernetes cluster the Marketplace solution can be cleaned up with the following commands:

```shell
kubectl delete application "${NAME}" -n "${NAMESPACE}"
kubectl delete -n "${NAMESPACE}" $(kubectl get pvc -n "${NAMESPACE}" -o name)
```

Or you can simply delete the entire namespace if you created it during installation, and it's no longer needed:

```shell
kubectl delete namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

# Releasing

Once all local testing is completed successfully and the images are tagged, create the version on the Marketplace
Producer Portal and submit it.

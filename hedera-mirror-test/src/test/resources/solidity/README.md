# Hedera Mirror Node Sample Smart Contract Project

This project demonstrates a basic smart contract use case using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) ethereum development
environment. It comes with some sample contracts, test files for those contracts, a sample script that deploys that
contract, and an example of a task implementation which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

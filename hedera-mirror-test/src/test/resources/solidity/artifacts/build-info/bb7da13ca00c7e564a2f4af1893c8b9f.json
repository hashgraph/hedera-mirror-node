Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"title\":\"ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional metadata extension\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":\"IERC721Metadata\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1000},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xab28a56179c1db258c9bf5235b382698cb650debecb51b23d12be9e241374b68\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://daae589a9d6fa7e55f99f86c0a16796ca490f243fb3693632c3711c0646c1d56\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmR3zpd7wNw3rcUdekwiv6FYHJqksuTCXLVioTxu6Fbxk3\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x75b829ff2f26c14355d1cba20e16fe7b29ca58eb5fef665ede48bc0f9c6c74b9\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://a0a107160525724f9e1bbbab031defc2f298296dd9e331f16a6f7130cec32146\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmemujxSd7gX8A9M8UwmNbz4Ms3U9FG9QfudUgxwvTmPWf\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol":{"IERC165":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"bytes4","name":"interfaceId","type":"bytes4"}],"name":"supportsInterface","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{"supportsInterface(bytes4)":"01ffc9a7"}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes4\",\"name\":\"interfaceId\",\"type\":\"bytes4\"}],\"name\":\"supportsInterface\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bool\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bool\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Interface of the ERC165 standard, as defined in the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[EIP].

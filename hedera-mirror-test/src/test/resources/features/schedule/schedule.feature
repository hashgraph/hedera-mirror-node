  Scenario Outline: Validate Base Schedule Flow - ScheduleCreate of CryptoTransfer and ScheduleSign
    Given I successfully schedule a HBAR transfer from treasury to ALICE with expiration time "null" and wait for expiry "false"
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the schedule transaction
    And the mirror node REST API should verify the "NON_EXECUTED" schedule entity with expiration time "null" and wait for expiry "false"
    Given I successfully delete the schedule
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the schedule transaction
    And the mirror node REST API should verify the "DELETED" schedule entity with expiration time "null" and wait for expiry "false"
    Given I successfully schedule a HBAR transfer from treasury to ALICE with expiration time "5s" and wait for expiry "true"
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the schedule transaction
    Then I wait until the schedule's expiration time
    And the mirror node REST API should verify the "EXPIRED" schedule entity with expiration time "5s" and wait for expiry "true"
    Given I successfully schedule a HBAR transfer from treasury to ALICE with expiration time "60s" and wait for expiry "false"
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the schedule transaction
    And the mirror node REST API should verify the "NON_EXECUTED" schedule entity with expiration time "60s" and wait for expiry "false"
    When the scheduled transaction is signed by treasuryAccount
    And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the schedule transaction
    And the mirror node REST API should verify the "EXECUTED" schedule entity with expiration time "60s" and wait for expiry "false"
    Given I successfully schedule a HBAR transfer from treasury to ALICE with expiration time "16s" and wait for expiry "true"
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the schedule transaction
    And the mirror node REST API should verify the "NON_EXECUTED" schedule entity with expiration time "16s" and wait for expiry "true"
    When the scheduled transaction is signed by treasuryAccount
    And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the schedule transaction
    Then I wait until the schedule's expiration time
    And the mirror node REST API should verify the "EXECUTED" schedule entity with expiration time "16s" and wait for expiry "true"

    Examples:
      | httpStatusCode |
      | 200            |

    Scenario Outline: Validate Base Token Flow with Custom Fees Schedule - Create, Associate, Fund, Transfer
        # create the first token for fixed fee paid in token
        Given I successfully create a new token
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        # create the second token with empty custom fees so we can associate recipient accounts
        Given I successfully create a new token
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        # create 4 recipients, 0 as hbar fee collector, 1 as fixed fee token collector, 2 as fractional fee collector,
        # and the last as token transfer recipient
        Given I associate a new recipient account with token 0
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Given I associate a new recipient account with token 0
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Given I associate a new recipient account with token 1
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Given I associate a new recipient account with token 1
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        # create a sender account, the sender account needs to associate with both tokens
        Given I associate a new sender account with token 0
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Given I associate an existing sender account 0 with token 1
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        # fund the sender account with both tokens
        Given I transfer <fundAmount> tokens 0 to sender
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for token 0 fund flow
        Given I transfer <fundAmount> tokens 1 to sender
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for token 1 fund flow
        # update token 1's custom fees schedule
        Given I update token 1 with new custom fees schedule
          | amount | numerator | denominator | collector | maximum | minimum | token |
          | 100    |           |             | 0         |         |         |       |
          | 10     |           |             | 1         |         |         | 0     |
          |        | 1         | 10          | 2         |         |         |       |
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        # make a transfer from sender 0 to the last recipient and verify the assessed custom fees
        When Sender 0 transfers 200 tokens 1 to recipient 3
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for token 1 fund flow with assessed custom fees
          | amount | collector | payer | token |
          | 100    | 0         | 0     |       |
          | 10     | 1         | 0     | 0     |
          | 20     | 2         | 0     | 1     |

        Examples:
            | fundAmount | httpStatusCode |
            | 3000       | 200            |

    Scenario: Validate Base Token Creation with Updated Custom Fees Schedule - Create, UpdateFeeSchedule
        Given I successfully create a new token
        And I associate a new recipient account with token 0
        And I successfully create a new token with custom fees schedule
          | amount | numerator | denominator | collector | maximum | minimum | token |
          | 50     |           |             | 0         |         |         |       |

        Then the mirror node REST API should confirm token 1 with custom fees schedule
        Given I associate an existing recipient account 0 with token 1
        And I update token 1 with new custom fees schedule
          | amount | numerator | denominator | collector | maximum | minimum | token |
          | 7      |           |             | 0         |         |         |       |
          | 13     |           |             | 0         |         |         | 0     |

        Then the mirror node REST API should confirm token 1 with custom fees schedule

    Scenario Outline: Validate Base Token Flow - Create, Associate, Fund
        Given I successfully create a new token
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        When I associate a new recipient account with token
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Then I transfer <amount> tokens to recipient
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for token fund flow
        Examples:
            | amount | httpStatusCode |
            | 2350   | 200            |

    Scenario Outline: Validate Freeze and KYC Flow - Create, Unfreeze, GrantKyc
        Given I successfully create a new token with freeze status <initialFreezeStatus> and kyc status <initialKycStatus>
        When I associate a new recipient account with token
        And I set new account freeze status to <newFreezeStatus>
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        And I set new account kyc status to <newKycStatus>
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Examples:
            | initialFreezeStatus | initialKycStatus | newFreezeStatus | newKycStatus | httpStatusCode |

        Given I successfully create a new token
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        When I associate a new recipient account with token
        And I transfer <amount> tokens to recipient
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for token fund flow
        Then I update the token
        And the mirror node REST API should confirm token update
        Then I burn <modifySupplyAmount> from the token
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Then I mint <modifySupplyAmount> from the token
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Then I wipe <modifySupplyAmount> from the token
        And the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode>
        Examples:
            | amount | httpStatusCode | modifySupplyAmount |

        #TODO This test should be updated when services enables the ability to change NFT treasury accounts.
        Then I update the treasury of token 0 to recipient 0

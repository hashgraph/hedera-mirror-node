Feature: Account NFT Allowance Coverage Feature

  @critical @release @acceptance
  Scenario Outline: Validate approval NftTransfer affect on NftAllowance
    Given I ensure NFT <tokenName> has been created
    And I associate account <recipient> with NFT <tokenName>
    Then the mirror node REST API should return the transaction for the NFTs
    Then I mint a serial number from the NFT
    And the mirror node REST API should return the transaction for token serial number 0
    Given I approve <spender> to all serials of the NFT
    Then the mirror node REST API should confirm the approved allowance of NFT <tokenName> and <spender> when owner is "true"
    And the mirror node REST API should confirm the approved allowance of NFT <tokenName> and <spender> when owner is "false"
    Given <spender> transfers serial number 0 to <recipient>
    Then the mirror node REST API should confirm the approved transfer of serial number 0 and confirm the new owner is <recipient>
    When I delete the allowance on NFT <tokenName> for <spender>
    Then the mirror node REST API should confirm the approved allowance for NFT <tokenName> and <spender> is no longer available
    Examples:
      | tokenName      | spender | recipient |
      | ALLOWANCENONFUNGIBLE  | BOB  | ALICE     |

Feature: Ethereum transactions Coverage Feature

  Scenario Outline: Validate Ethereum Contract create and call


  Given I successfully created a signer account with an EVM address alias
  Then validate the signer account and its balance

  Given I successfully create contract by Legacy ethereum transaction
  Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the eth contract creation transaction
  And the mirror node contract results API should return an accurate gas consumed
  And the mirror node REST API should verify the ethereum called contract function

  When I successfully call function using EIP-1559 ethereum transaction
  Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the ethereum transaction
  And the mirror node contract results API should return an accurate gas consumed
  And the mirror node REST API should verify the ethereum called contract function

  Given I successfully call function using EIP-2930 ethereum transaction
  Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the ethereum transaction
  And the mirror node contract results API should return an accurate gas consumed
  And the mirror node REST API should verify the ethereum called contract function

  Examples:
    | httpStatusCode |
    | 200            |

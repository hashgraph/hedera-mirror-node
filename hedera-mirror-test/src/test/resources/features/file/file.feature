    Scenario Outline: Validate File Flow - FileCreate, FileAppend, FileUpdate, FileDelete
        Given I successfully create a file
        When the network confirms file presence
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the file transaction
        When I successfully update the file
        And the network confirms partial file contents
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the file transaction
        When I successfully append to the file
        And the network confirms an append update
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the file transaction
        When I successfully delete the file
        And the network confirms file absence
        Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the file transaction
        Examples:
            | httpStatusCode |
            | 200            |

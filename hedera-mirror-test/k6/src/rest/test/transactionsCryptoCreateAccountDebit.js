/**
 * This is a very particular test case related to https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/issues/2385.
 * While testing performance issues, it was found that calls using both the transaction type (e.g. CRYPTOCREATEACCOUNT)
 * and balance modification type (e.g. debit) query string parameters, performance was especially slow. API calls would timeout after 20 seconds.
 * This test uses hard-coded transaction type and balance modification type values because slow performance seems to be
 * associated with a less frequently used transaction type.
 * An attempt to make this test more generic seems to have low-value while also making variable names confusing.
